# React Quote Machine
<hr>
This project is the first in the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries curriculum. This was my first time using React, and I really enjoyed it. Despite some formatting troubles getting my CSS to style correctly, I was able to get it up and running! It generates a random quote on load using an useEffect hook, allows the user to Tweet the current quote, and changes the background color for every new quote. I used an API from https://type.fit/api/quotes to get the quotes, and learned about the async/await pattern for REST APIs.
